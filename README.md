 # Task 03 
📌 Project Title
Predicting Customer Subscription Using Decision Tree Classifier

📁 Task Objective
Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

This task uses the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to model customer behavior and enhance marketing strategies.
